# ForexScrappingBot
This is a simple Scrapping Bot for a forex traing website. 
At the request of the user, I explicitly used only selenium headless, even if it is not the fastest and recommended option. Also, the algorithm does not have a GUI and all the extracted data will be displayed on the interpreter's console. Basically, using headless selenium, the algorithm takes the news from the main page and displays only the data of those that have a high impact and affect the USD currency.
